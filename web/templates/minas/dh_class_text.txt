      The Minimum Information about any Ancient Sequence (MInAS) project aims 
      to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and 
      sequencing data via community-based consensus and training.
      This schema is a combination of the core MIxS schemas, plus all MInAS related
      extensions (currently includes extension-ancient, and extension-radiocarbon-dating).

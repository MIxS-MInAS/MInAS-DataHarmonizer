      The Minimum Information about any Ancient Sequence (MInAS) project aims 
      to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and 
      sequencing data via community-based consensus and training.
      This extension is a prototype 'technical' MIxS extension with metadata terms
      specific for including specific radiocarbon dating (C14) metadata about 
      samples for providing additional technical contextual information.
